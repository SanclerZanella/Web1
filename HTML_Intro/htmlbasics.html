    <h1>What is HTML?</h1>

    <p>
        HTML stand for Hyper Text Markup Language.
        'Hyper Text' means the document contains links to allow the user to navigate to other places
        in the document or to another document. 'Markup Language' is a means of providing in structions
        to a computer as to how it should process and present text, medias, etc. contained in the document.
        These instructions are provided using 'Tags' and 'Attributes'.
    </p>

    <h1>HTML Tags</h1>

    <p>
        Tags are used in HTML to 'mark-up' where an element begins and (where relevant) end.
        Tags are enclosed with '< >'.
        As you can see, the opening tag for this element looks like &lt;p&gt; and its closing tag
        looks &lt;/p&gt;. Note the forward-slash in the closing tag.
    </p>

    <h1>HTML Attributes</h1>

    <p>
        We can use attributes when need to provide more information about an element.
        Attributes details including the attribute name and the associated information
        text, are specified inside an opening html tag.
        &lt;tagname attributename=attributevalue&gt;
    </p>
